# ANDROID-DEVELOPMENT
smart trash management application uses Android phone sensors to make waste reporting and clean-up more efficient and engaging. GPS is used to automatically capture the location of overflowing bins and to map nearby clean-up events. The camera allows users to take photos as evidence and can help identify recyclable materials. The step counter and accelerometer support gamification by rewarding users for movement during clean-ups, encouraging participation. The light sensor improves photo quality and adapts the app interface for outdoor use, while the microphone enables quick voice reporting. Together, these sensors improve accuracy, increase user engagement, and promote responsible waste management while respecting battery life and user privacy.
